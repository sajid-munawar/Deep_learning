**Familiarity with many simple mathematical concepts:**
1. Tensors
2. Tensor operations
3. Differentiation
4. Gradient descent

The core building block of neural networks is the _layer_, a data-processing module that
you can think of as a filter for data. Some data goes in, and it comes out in a more useful form. Specifically, layers extract representations out of the data fed into them hopefully, representations that are more meaningful for the problem at hand. Most of
deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers that will implement a form
of progressive data distillation. A deep-learning model is like a sieve for data processing, made of a succession of increasingly refined data filtersâ€”the layers.
