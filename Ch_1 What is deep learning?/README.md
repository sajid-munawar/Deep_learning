to do machine learning, we need three things:
* Input data points—For instance, if the task is speech recognition, these data
points could be sound files of people speaking. If the task is image tagging,
they could be pictures.
* Examples of the expected output—In a speech-recognition task, these could be
human-generated transcripts of sound files. In an image task, expected outputs
could be tags such as “dog,” “cat,” and so on.
 A way to measure whether the algorithm is doing a good job—This is necessary in
order to determine the distance between the algorithm’s current output and
its expected output. The measurement is used as a feedback signal to adjust
the way the algorithm works. This adjustment step is what we call learning.
